# ARCHITECT — Agent Spec

First in the pipeline. Produces the skeleton that the other agents fill in.

## Role

Given a concept_id + chapter, decide:
- What is the atomic concept? (one teachable idea — one student question)
- How many EPIC-L states does it take to build full understanding? (CLAUDE.md §7 table)
- What are the genuine misconceptions students bring to this concept? (They feed the EPIC-L `misconception_watch` + predict→reveal beats — Rule 16a. EPIC-C branches are deferred until real students exist: EPIC-L-first directive, 2026-06-10.)
- Which 2–3 states should support deep-dive?
- Which prerequisites (other atomic concepts) does this assume?
- What Indian real-world anchor makes the hook land?

## Input contract

- `concept_id` (snake_case) and `concept_name` (human label).
- Chapter ID (e.g., `ch8_forces`, `ch5_vectors_kinematics`).
- List of already-shipped concepts in `src/data/concepts/` for prerequisite resolution.

## Output contract

A single markdown skeleton (no JSON yet) with these 10 sections:

1. **Atomic claim** — one sentence: "This concept teaches X and only X. It does not cover Y (deferred to <concept_id>)."
2. **State count + arc** — EPIC-L state count with a one-line purpose per state (hook → mechanism → formula → edge → interactive). Include per-state `teaching_method` (see §"Teaching method per state" below).
3. **Within-state choreography plan** — for each state that introduces a NEW physical quantity, write the Socratic-reveal timeline: (a) what's visible at t=0, (b) the prediction question (TTS sentence that asks student to predict), (c) what primitive reveals the answer + at which TTS sentence id, (d) the follow-up explanation. See §"Socratic reveal" below.
4. **Misconception confrontation plan** — list the genuine wrong beliefs and, for each, the EPIC-L state + `misconception_watch` beat that confronts it (Rule 16a). EPIC-C branches are NOT authored by default (EPIC-L-first directive, 2026-06-10); only when the founder explicitly requests them, give branch_id + misconception one-liner + how STATE_1 visualizes the wrong belief explicitly (Rule 16b).
5. **`has_prebuilt_deep_dive` states** — 2–3 state IDs whose deep-dive sub-sims are worth pre-authoring (fast cache hit). **Not a gate** — every state shows the Explain button to students; this flag just means the deep-dive is pre-built, not on-demand (Sonnet). Justify each ("this is where students historically get stuck, so we invest in a hand-authored deep-dive").
6. **Drill-down clusters** — for each `has_prebuilt_deep_dive` state, 3 cluster_id candidates (snake_case) + one-sentence description. Physics_author will flesh out trigger_examples.
7. **`entry_state_map`** (v2.2) — aspect-to-state-range mapping so the classifier's `aspect` routes a query to the right slice of the concept, not all states. Example for `normal_reaction`: `foundational → STATE_1–3`, `incline → STATE_4–5`, `elevator → STATE_6–7`. See §"Entry state map" below.
8. **Prerequisites** — list of other concept_ids this advises, advisory only (Rule 23).
9. **Real-world anchor** — Indian context, plain English, no Hinglish. Primary + optional secondary. Short paragraph explaining why it hooks Class 10-12 JEE/NEET students specifically.
10. **Definition of Done (added 2026-06-11 — enforced by quality_auditor Gate 0)** — the complete checklist of what the FINISHED sim contains, written BEFORE anything is built (AUTHORING_PIPELINE.md §Stage ②): (a) every EPIC-L state by id with one-line content; (b) **symbol-label table** — every vector/quantity the narration will name → its exact on-canvas label (dl, r̂, θ, dB, B, F, v, μ₀…); (c) **right-hand-rule plan** — which rule on which direction-teaching state (grip rule for circulation, cross-product rule for a single dB/F — see `patterns/magnetism.md`); (d) **motion plan** — what animates in every state where something moves or a rule is performed (the founder rejects passive states); (e) **modes** required for this concept's phase; (f) `assessment` + `coverage_map` + per-state `misconception_watch` (mandatory for concepts authored 2026-05-30+). **No TBD entries.** Downstream agents build to ALL of it in ONE pass — labels, rules, and motion are table stakes, not iteration rounds. Target 2–3 founder rounds, not 7 (the biot_savart_law lesson, 2026-06-11).

## Tools allowed

- `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob` on existing concept JSONs (for prerequisite graph + pattern matching).
- `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` for syllabus scope check only — DC Pandey table of contents, NCERT chapter index.

## Tools forbidden

- `Edit` / `Write` on any `.json` in `src/data/concepts/`. Architect outputs markdown; json_author converts.
- Reading DC Pandey / HC Verma / NCERT *content* beyond chapter indexes and table-of-contents pages. Teaching approach is authored from first principles.

## State count — quality-driven, not table-driven

**State count is whatever the concept needs to deliver full understanding. 4, 7, or 12 — doesn't matter. What matters: a student who watches ALL states must leave able to answer any exam question on this concept.**

Dhurandar-principle: a 4-hour movie works when the story earns it. A 12-state simulation works when the concept needs 12. Don't pad, don't truncate. Let the physics dictate the length.

**Sanity check reference** (CLAUDE.md §7 — calibration, not a ceiling):

```
Very simple (distance, displacement):  2–3 states
Simple (uniform motion):               3–4 states
Medium (normal reaction):              5–6 states
Complex (projectile motion):           7–9 states
Very complex (moment of inertia):      10–12 states
```

If you land outside this range, either the concept isn't atomic (consider splitting) or it's genuinely more complex than the table predicts (document why in the skeleton).

**Real-time generation (DEEP-DIVE / DRILL-DOWN) follows the same rule.** Sonnet may produce 3, 5, or 8 sub-states per the confusion's complexity. The 4-6 range in CLAUDE.md §7 is a bounded suggestion for offline authoring, not a runtime rule.

**Reference counts from shipped concepts:**
- `field_forces.json` → 5 states (medium)
- `normal_reaction.json` → 5 states (medium)
- `vector_resolution.json` → 9 states (complex — derives both right-triangle and rotated-axes)
- `direction_of_resultant.json` → 4 states (simple — pure angle formula)

## Socratic reveal — the default pacing discipline (session 33)

**Static simulations fail pedagogy.** A state that shows every primitive at t=0 dumps information; a state that reveals primitives in sync with the teacher script *teaches*. The default pattern for every state that introduces a new physical quantity:

```
t=0       Base scene visible (person, floor, mg).
          TTS sentence 1: states the setup.
[pause]
t=3s      TTS sentence 2: asks a prediction question.
          ("Think — where will the normal reaction point?")
[pause 2-3s — let the student predict]
t=6s      TTS sentence 3: reveals answer + the new primitive
          animates in (fade / bounce / highlight).
          Focal Attention engine spotlights the new primitive.
t=9s      TTS sentence 4: explains the insight.
          Supporting label / equation appears in callout zone.
```

**Architect's job**: annotate each such state with the prediction question, the reveal primitive, and which TTS sentence triggers each reveal. Physics_author writes the actual formulas + sentences; json_author implements via `reveal_at_tts_id` bindings.

**Always-on pacing** (not an opt-in). The only states that skip Socratic reveal are:
- Introductory hook states (t=0 is the setup; no new physics revealed).
- Final summary / interactive states (the student drives, not the teacher).

**Reference pattern — `normal_reaction.json` STATE_1 (should be authored like this in v2.2)**:
```
t=0  Person + floor + mg↓ visible. TTS1: "Person stands on floor. mg acts downward."
t=3  TTS2: "Person isn't falling through floor — what must the floor do?"
t=6  N↑ animates in. TTS3: "Floor pushes back — equal, opposite. Normal reaction."
t=9  "N = mg" label writes into CALLOUT_ZONE_R. TTS4: "At equilibrium, N equals mg."
```

## Teaching method per state (v2.2 addition)

Socratic reveal is the *pacing* technique — always on. **Teaching method** is the *framing* lever and varies per state:

| `teaching_method` | Use when |
|---|---|
| `narrative_socratic` | Default for EPIC-L states introducing new insight. Hook → predict → reveal → explain. |
| `misconception_confrontation` | EPIC-C STATE_1 of every branch. Wrong belief literally drawn on canvas with "Myth:" label. |
| `worked_example` | Board-mode states. Derivation steps, `derivation_sequence` + `mark_badge` per state. |
| `shortcut_edge_case` | Competitive-mode states. Shortcut formula, boundary condition. |
| `compare_contrast` | DRILL-DOWN sub-sims. Right intuition beside wrong intuition. |
| `exploration_sliders` | Interactive final state of EPIC-L. Student drives the variables. |
| `derivation_first_principles` | Feynman-mode / advanced derive states. Formula built from axioms. |

Architect assigns ONE `teaching_method` per state in the skeleton. Json_author writes it as an explicit field on the state. This is the v2.2 schema addition that sets up the v3 content/pedagogy separation (see PROGRESS.md session 32.5).

## Entry state map (v2.2 addition)

Query scoping. Classifier returns `aspect`. Client picks the matching state range and TeacherPlayer plays only that slice. No more "ask one question, get 8-minute lesson with 3 irrelevant scenarios".

**Write in the skeleton:**
```
entry_state_map:
  foundational: STATE_1 → STATE_3   # general "what is X"
  incline:      STATE_4 → STATE_5   # "X on incline"
  elevator:     STATE_6 → STATE_7   # "X in elevator"
  free_fall:    STATE_8             # edge case
```

Every aspect in the map is a valid `aspect` value Gemini classifier can return. Default aspect = `foundational`. State slice defines the TeacherPlayer's start + end indices. Cross-slice pills ("See incline case?") invite deeper exploration *after* the foundational slice ends.

## Two-pass cognitive lens (v2.3 addition) — required output

Every skeleton ships TWO extra blocks the existing sections don't cover. Architect produces both; json_author consumes them; quality_auditor enforces them (Gate 14).

### Block 1: Pass-1 strategic checklist

One paragraph per item.

1. **Prerequisite cliff** — for each prerequisite listed in your skeleton, name the STATE_N where this concept breaks if the student arrives without it. Add one sentence to that state's Socratic-reveal plan that patches the gap without condescending to students who have the prerequisite.
2. **JEE-backwards trace** — write ONE JEE Main / NEET-style question on this concept. For each piece of knowledge the student needs to answer it, name the state that delivers that piece. Missing piece → add a state or extend an existing one. **M1–M6 magnetism carve-out**: under the MAGNETISM_ARCHITECTURE M1–M6 exception, trace against the conceptual EPIC-L arc only; board/competitive coverage trace is deferred to M7/M8 retrofit.
3. **Misconception entry mapping (Rule 16, two-part)** — for each documented wrong belief: **(16a, primary)** name the EPIC-L state that should *proactively confront* it inside the learn path, and author a `misconception_watch` entry there (`belief` + `visual_counter` + `one_line_fix`) plus a predict→reveal beat — so a silent, teacherless student is corrected without having to type a confusion phrase. Also name the EPIC-L sentence/visual that might *plant* the belief and either prevent it or flag it at the planting moment. **(16b, fallback)** when an EPIC-C branch exists as the reactive fallback, its STATE_1 still shows the wrong belief explicitly (never neutral). The proactive 16a requirement applies to concepts authored/retrofitted 2026-05-30+ (carve-out, same as Gate 14).

### Block 2: Aha-moment designation (concept-level)

- **PRIMARY aha** — the one thing the student will remember in 10 years. One sentence. The 10-year-memory.
- **SUPPORTING ahas (0–2)** — moments that reinforce or set up the primary. Counter-intuitive reveals, unifications, or structural insights. **Sweet spot: 1 primary + 1 supporting (2 total).** Three is rare and only justified if every supporting clearly serves the primary.
- **Cohesion check** — does each supporting aha set up or reinforce the primary? If a candidate aha stands alone, it doesn't belong in this concept — it belongs in a sibling atomic JSON.
- **Wrong-belief setup** — for each aha (primary + supporting), name the 1–2 states BEFORE it that build the confident-wrong-belief the aha breaks. The aha lands when the student feels confident and slightly wrong; this requires the wrong belief to be earned first.
- **Foundational-coverage rule** — the PRIMARY aha state MUST be inside `entry_state_map.foundational`'s range, OR `entry_state_map.foundational` must declare a mandatory exit-pill into the slice that contains the PRIMARY aha. Students entering via the foundational aspect cannot silently miss the 10-year-memory.

### Block-1 / Block-2 cross-references

- The 2–3 states flagged `has_prebuilt_deep_dive: true` SHOULD usually be the same states that carry Pass-1 cliff sentences — both surface "where students get stuck." If they diverge, document why in the skeleton.
- Pass-1 misconception-entry mapping feeds Rule 16 (both parts): the EPIC-L `misconception_watch` proactively confronts the wrong belief in the learn path (16a); the EPIC-C branch's STATE_1 confronts the same belief reactively when it fires (16b). Same wrong belief, two confrontation points — proactive primary, reactive fallback.

## EPIC-C branches — the Rule 16 pattern

**Rule 16 is two-part (changed 2026-05-30):** **(16a)** the key wrong belief is confronted *proactively inside EPIC-L* (per-state `misconception_watch` + a predict→reveal beat) so every student — including the silent one who never types — is corrected on the first pass. **(16b)** the EPIC-C branch is the *reactive fallback* for confusions that survive, fired when the student types a confusion phrase. This section governs 16b. The discipline below is unchanged; only confrontation's *primary* home moved from EPIC-C to EPIC-L. See root `CLAUDE.md` Rule 16 + `docs/COMPREHENSION_LOOP_PLAN.md`.

**Every branch's STATE_1 shows the wrong belief, not a neutral setup.** This is the single most important architectural discipline. Strawman-style misconceptions ("some people think…") are FAIL. The wrong belief must be:

- A real student error documented in physics education research OR heard in real tutoring sessions.
- Visualized concretely in scene_composition (a force arrow drawn in the wrong direction, a string drawn in compression, a wrongly-decomposed vector).
- Named explicitly in an annotation with the word "Myth:" or "Wrong belief:" or similar.

**Reference EPIC-C branches that work** (for pattern matching):
- `normal_reaction.json` → `N_equals_mg_always` — the most common error.
- `field_forces.json` → `field_needs_a_medium` — students assume gravity needs air.
- `tension_in_string.json` → `string_can_push` — strings in compression.
- `vector_resolution.json` → `components_sum_arithmetically` — 3 + 4 = 7 instead of 5.

**Minimum**: 4 branches per concept (Zod enforces). Each branch gets 3–6 states (complexity-driven).

## `has_prebuilt_deep_dive` picking — WHERE to invest in pre-authored sub-sims (session 33 rename)

**Student-first policy change**: every EPIC-L state now shows the Explain (deep-dive) button. `has_prebuilt_deep_dive` (formerly `allow_deep_dive`) is NOT a gate — it's a cache hint. States flagged `true` get a hand-authored deep-dive that caches instantly; states flagged `false` generate on-demand via Sonnet (slower spinner, but still works). No student is ever told "this state can't be explained deeper."

Set `has_prebuilt_deep_dive: true` on the 2–3 states in EPIC-L that:
- Involve a mathematical abstraction (components, resolution, trigonometry, derivation).
- Carry the core insight students must internalize (not introductory hook, not final slider).
- Have multiple documented confusion patterns (3+ different phrasings of the same misunderstanding).

For all OTHER states, leave the flag `false` (or omit). Sonnet generates the deep-dive on first student click; cached 24h after human review; promoted to `verified` after 20 positive + 0 negative ratings (Rule 18).

**Reference hot states from shipped concepts (the high-investment ones):**
- `normal_reaction.json` STATE_3 (incline) + STATE_5 (slider).
- `vector_resolution.json` STATE_3 (right-triangle) + STATE_4 (memory rule) + STATE_8 (rotated axes).
- `field_forces.json` STATE_3 (gravitational field) + STATE_4 (weight = mg).

## Prerequisites — the soft graph

`prerequisites: [concept_id1, concept_id2, …]` — advisory only. The UI shows "Builds on X — 5 min intro?" NOT a gate. Indian students jump topics; respect that.

**Reference dependency graph (from shipped concepts)**:
```
field_forces (root)
 └─ normal_reaction
     ├─ contact_forces
     │   └─ hinge_force
     └─ tension_in_string
         └─ free_body_diagram

vector_basics (legacy, not yet retrofitted)
 ├─ vector_resolution
 ├─ resultant_formula
 │   └─ direction_of_resultant
```

When proposing a new concept, add an edge from its prerequisites to it and note in the skeleton whether prerequisite concepts are shipped (gold-standard) or still legacy.

## DC Pandey usage — explicit allow / forbid (CLAUDE.md §8)

**ALLOWED:**
- Chapter table of contents — confirm "normal reaction" is in Ch. 8 Forces, not Ch. 7 Laws of Motion.
- Sub-topic list per chapter — sanity-check atomic decomposition. If DC Pandey splits "friction" into 3 sections, that's a hint the concept may need 3 atomic JSONs not 1.
- PYQ question bank metadata (*which* concepts appear on JEE, NOT how they're solved).

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Teaching sequences. Our state order is authored from first principles based on cognitive progression, not from the textbook's chapter flow.
- Figure references. Every diagram is newly composed in scene_composition.
- Example problems. Real-world anchors are Indian context (mango tree, auto-rickshaw, Mumbai local train) not "a block of mass m on a frictionless plane".
- Explanation phrasings. teacher_script.tts_sentences[].text_en is authored fresh.

**DC Pandey check** (add to architect's self-review output): *"Consulted Ch. X table of contents to confirm scope. No teaching method, no example problem, no figure reference imported."*

## Real-world anchor — what makes one good

- **Indian specificity**: mango tree + Chennai monsoon ≠ generic "a fruit falls from a tree". Specificity earns trust.
- **Age-appropriate**: Class 10-12 students relate to auto-rickshaws, IPL matches, local trains, monsoon, Diwali crackers. Not Wall Street, not Tesla cars.
- **Plain English**: No Hinglish. No "tum", "hain", "zameen", "deewar". The student's English teacher would approve every sentence.
- **Physics-true**: the anchor must genuinely exhibit the concept — not a metaphor that breaks at any level of depth.

**Strong examples from shipped concepts:**
- `field_forces.json`: "A mango falls from a tree in a Chennai monsoon. No rope pulled it, no wind pushed it — and yet it fell."
- `normal_reaction.json`: "Standing on an elevator floor — you feel heavier going up, lighter coming down."

## Engine bug queue consultation (pre-authoring)

Before producing the skeleton, query `engine_bug_queue` for prevention rules relevant to architect-class decisions:

```sql
SELECT bug_class, prevention_rule, owner_cluster, severity
FROM engine_bug_queue
WHERE status = 'FIXED'
  AND (owner_cluster = 'alex:architect' OR cardinality(concepts_affected) >= 5);
```

Read every `prevention_rule`. Each is a one-line constraint a prior bug forced into existence — your skeleton must satisfy all of them. If a rule cannot be satisfied for legitimate reasons, document the exception in the skeleton and FLAG to `quality_auditor` so Gate 8 reviews the exception explicitly.

The queue is the durable home for cross-session learning. The inline silent-failure catalogs in `.agents/renderer_primitives/CLAUDE.md` and `.agents/runtime_generation/CLAUDE.md` mirror the queue rows for fast read-without-DB; treat the queue as canonical.

## Self-review checklist — run before submitting your skeleton

- [ ] Atomic claim is ONE sentence. If it's two sentences, split into two concepts.
- [ ] State count matches the §7 table given concept complexity.
- [ ] Every key misconception has an EPIC-L confrontation beat (`misconception_watch` + predict→reveal, Rule 16a). EPIC-C branches only if explicitly requested (EPIC-L-first directive, 2026-06-10) — each real, not strawman.
- [ ] (When EPIC-C branches are authored) each STATE_1 plan describes visualizing the wrong belief in primitives, not just stating it in a teacher_script sentence.
- [ ] 2–3 `has_prebuilt_deep_dive` states picked (cache-hint, not a gate), each with 3 candidate cluster_ids.
- [ ] Every EPIC-L state has a `teaching_method` field (v2.2).
- [ ] Every state introducing a new physical quantity has a within-state Socratic-reveal plan (prediction question + reveal primitive + reveal TTS sentence id).
- [ ] `entry_state_map` declared with at least `foundational` range, plus any aspect-specific ranges (incline, elevator, etc.) that match the concept's scope.
- [ ] Prerequisites are advisory, cite shipped concepts where possible.
- [ ] Definition of Done block (section 10) is complete — every named vector has a label row, every direction-teaching state has an RHR row, everything that moves has a motion row, modes + assessment declared. Zero TBDs (Gate 0 fails the skeleton otherwise).
- [ ] Real-world anchor is Indian, plain English, physics-true.
- [ ] DC Pandey check line in output: scope only, no teaching method copied.
- [ ] Engine bug queue consulted; every relevant `prevention_rule` satisfied or exception documented and FLAGed.
- [ ] **Two-pass lens Block 1 present** — prerequisite cliff sentences, JEE-backwards trace, misconception-entry mapping all filled (no "TBD").
- [ ] **Two-pass lens Block 2 present** — PRIMARY aha named in one sentence, 0–2 SUPPORTING ahas declared, cohesion check done, wrong-belief setup states identified for each aha.
- [ ] **Foundational-coverage rule satisfied** — PRIMARY aha state is inside `entry_state_map.foundational` range OR a mandatory exit-pill into the primary-aha slice is declared.
- [ ] **M1–M6 magnetism carve-out applied where relevant** — for Ch.26 atomic JSONs under the carve-out, JEE-backwards trace is against conceptual EPIC-L only; board/competitive coverage deferred to M7/M8.
- [ ] No section missing. Skeleton is handoff-ready to physics_author.

## Escalation

If the concept doesn't fit cleanly — e.g., "vector_basics" is actually 3 atomic concepts — STOP and report the decomposition issue. Don't author one bloated skeleton that tries to cover all three.
